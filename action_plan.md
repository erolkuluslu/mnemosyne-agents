# Updated Action Plan for Multi-Modal Agentic Platform

Below is an **updated action plan** that factors in the new Orchestrator code you've added. This roadmap continues to follow the **phased** approach, but now explicitly acknowledges the **Orchestrator** foundation already in place. The steps are broken into **bite-sized, independently codable tasks**, ensuring each one yields a meaningful improvement while maintaining **Separation of Concerns** and a **Layered Architecture**.

---

## Phase 1: Foundational Orchestrator & Basic Text Interaction (Updated)

### 1.1 [X] Minimal Orchestrator
- **What We've Done**  
  - Created `Orchestrator` and `OrchestratorConfig` classes.  
  - Implemented a `process_input` method that logs user input and returns a placeholder response.  
  - Added a basic usage script (`basic_usage.py`) to demonstrate how to instantiate and call the Orchestrator.  
  - Confirmed logging works as intended (via `loguru`).

**Usage & Integration**:
```python
from mnemosyne.orchestrator import Orchestrator, OrchestratorConfig

orchestrator = Orchestrator(
    config=OrchestratorConfig(debug=True)
)
response = orchestrator.process_input("Your query here")
```

**Purpose**: Provides the foundation for all agent interactions and workflow management.
**Related Features**: Core component that all other features build upon.

### 1.2 [X] Integrate a Basic Text LLM
1. **Add LLM Client** [X]

            model="gpt-4"
        ),
        fallback_providers=[...]
    )
)
```

   - Demonstrated in `basic_usage.py`

**Usage**:
```python
orchestrator = Orchestrator(
    config=OrchestratorConfig(
        history_length=10  # Store last 10 messages
    )
)
```

**Purpose**: Enables context-aware conversations.
**Related Features**: Foundation for Vector DB integration.

### 1.4 [X] Enhanced Logging & Debugging
1. **Enhanced Debug Mode** [X]

## Phase 3: Refinement & Memory

### 3.1 Vector Database Integration
1. **Vector Store Setup**  
   - Choose a vector DB (e.g. Pinecone, Weaviate, or local LanceDB).  
   - Implement a small module (`vector_store.py`) for storing and retrieving text embeddings.
2. **Augmented Retrieval**  
   - For each user query, retrieve relevant context from the vector DB to inject into the LLM prompt (RAG approach).
3. **Persisted Memory**  
   - Optionally store conversation turns in the vector DB so that memory can survive restarts.

**Outcome**:  
A more robust memory mechanism and retrieval-augmented generation to reduce hallucinations.

        max_retries=3,
        initial_wait=1.0,
        max_wait=30.0
    )
)

# Encrypt sensitive data
encrypted = security.encrypt_data(sensitive_data)
decrypted = security.decrypt_data(encrypted)

# Retry mechanism
@Security.with_retries(max_tries=3, initial_wait=1.0, max_wait=5.0)
async def flaky_operation():
    # Your code here
    pass
```

**Purpose**: Ensures data security and system reliability.
**Related Features**: 
- Works with all agents to protect sensitive data (OCR results, audio transcripts)
- Enhances reliability of external API calls with retry mechanism

### 3.3 [X] Performance & Monitoring
1. **Caching** [X]
   - Implemented TTL-based caching for embeddings and LLM responses
   - Added size limits and automatic cleanup of old entries
2. **Rate Limiting** [X]

   - Implemented type-specific limits (embedding/LLM)
   - Added exponential backoff for retries

**Usage**:
```python
from mnemosyne.caching import CacheManager, CacheConfig, RateLimitConfig

# Initialize cache manager
cache_manager = CacheManager(
    cache_config=CacheConfig(
        embedding_ttl=3600,  # 1 hour
        llm_response_ttl=1800,  # 30 minutes
        max_embedding_size=10000,
        max_llm_size=1000
    ),
    rate_limit_config=RateLimitConfig(

    # Your embedding code here
    pass

@cache_llm_response(cache_manager=cache_manager)
async def generate_response(prompt: str):
    # Your LLM code here
    pass
```

**Purpose**: Improves performance and reliability while controlling resource usage.
**Related Features**:

### 3.4 Advanced Workflows [X]

#### Prompt Chaining Library [X]
1. **Core Implementation** [X]
   - Created flexible `PromptChain` class with support for:
     - Linear chains (A → B → C)
     - Branching chains (A → [B1, B2] → C)
     - Dynamic chain modification during execution
     - Per-node validation before execution
   - Added comprehensive logging and error handling

2. **Node Types** [X]
   - PROMPT: LLM prompt nodes
   - BRANCH: Conditional branching nodes
   - MERGE: Combine results from multiple paths
   - TOOL: External tool/function calls

3. **Features** [X]
   - Context Management:
     - Variables passed between nodes
     - Results tracking
     - Execution path history
   - Dynamic Modification:
     - Add/remove nodes during execution
     - Modify connections between nodes
     - Conditional path selection

**Usage**:
```python
from mnemosyne.chains import (
    PromptChain,
    ChainNodeType,
    create_linear_chain,
    create_branching_chain
)

# Create a linear chain
chain = create_linear_chain(
    "text_processor",
    prompts=[
        "Analyze this text: {input_text}",
        "Summarize the analysis: {processed_text}"
    ],
    tools=[{
        "name": "text_processor",
        "params": {"text": "{input_text}"}
    }]
)

# Execute with context
results = await chain.execute(
    initial_context={"input_text": "Hello, World!"},
    tools={"text_processor": my_tool}
)

# Create a branching chain
branch_chain = create_branching_chain(
    "classifier",
    condition_prompt="Is this a question: {input_text}",
    true_branch=["Answer: {input_text}"],
    false_branch=["Process: {input_text}"]
)

# Dynamic modification
chain.add_node(...)
chain.connect(from_id, to_id)
```

**Purpose**: Enables creation of complex, dynamic prompt workflows.

**Benefits**:
- Modular and reusable prompt patterns
- Flexible workflow construction
- Dynamic adaptation to results
- Built-in validation and error handling
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

**Related Features**:
- Integrates with caching system for LLM responses
- Works with rate limiting for external API calls
- Supports all agent types (Text, Audio, Image, Video)
- Compatible with security module for sensitive data

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Workflows & Domain-Specific Agents

### 4.1 Prompt Chaining Library
1. **Chain Utility**  
   - Implement a reusable "PromptChain" class or decorator to define multi-step tasks (Outline → Validate → Expand).  
   - Let the Orchestrator load or execute these chains dynamically based on user requests.
2. **Testing**  
   - Provide small chain examples (like a "blog post writer" flow).

---

### 4.2 Orchestrator-Workers Pattern
1. **Worker Agents**  
   - Allow the Orchestrator to break larger tasks into subtasks, delegate to multiple "worker" LLM calls, then merge results.
2. **Advanced Logging**  
   - Log each subtask's input/output for easy debugging.

---

### 4.3 Enhanced Evaluator-Optimizer
1. **Multi-Criteria Evaluator**  
   - Evaluate based on factual accuracy, style, policy compliance, etc.  
   - Score the output in each category.
2. **Refinement Loop**  
   - If any category is below threshold, automatically generate a "fix prompt" to refine the text.

---

## Phase 5: Performance, Monitoring, & CI/CD

1. **Caching & Rate Control**  
   - Cache repeated LLM responses to reduce API calls.  
   - Implement basic rate limiting if supporting many concurrent users.
2. **Metrics**  
   - Track usage stats, latencies, error rates. Possibly integrate with Prometheus or similar monitoring.
3. **Continuous Integration**  
   - Set up tests to run on each pull request (e.g., GitHub Actions).  
   - Automatically build Docker images on merges to `main`.

---

## Phase 6: Extensions & Community Contributions

1. **Domain-Specific Agents**  
   - E.g. a "Code Generation Agent" that can read/write local files in a restricted sandbox.  
   - A "Legal Document Agent" that references known legal data from the vector store.
2. **UI Integrations**  
   - Optionally create a minimal web front-end or connect to no-code platforms (Rivet, Vellum, etc.).

---

# Where We Stand

- **Currently**:  
  - You have a **minimal Orchestrator** (`Orchestrator` & `OrchestratorConfig`) with basic logging and a placeholder response.  
  - A usage demo (`basic_usage.py`) confirms that the Orchestrator can handle text input and log the interaction.

- **Next Immediate Step**:  
  - **Tie in a live LLM** (see Phase 1.2) so that `process_input` produces real AI-driven responses.  
  - Then add **short-term in-memory conversation history** (Phase 1.3) for basic multi-turn interactions.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep PRs Small**: Implement each sub-step in its own branch and PR so code reviews remain manageable.  
- **Document as You Go**: Update `README.md` and your docstrings each time you add a new phase or feature.  
- **Test Often**: Each new feature (e.g., `AudioAgent`, `ImageAgent`) should come with at least a small test script or unit test.

With this updated plan, you'll **incrementally build** a powerful multi-modal agentic platform—starting with the **Orchestrator** you've already set up, then layering in specialized agents, memory, retrieval, and advanced workflows.
