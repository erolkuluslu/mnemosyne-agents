# Updated Action Plan for Multi-Modal Agentic Platform

Below is an **updated action plan** that factors in the new Orchestrator code you've added. This roadmap continues to follow the **phased** approach, but now explicitly acknowledges the **Orchestrator** foundation already in place. The steps are broken into **bite-sized, independently codable tasks**, ensuring each one yields a meaningful improvement while maintaining **Separation of Concerns** and a **Layered Architecture**.

---

## Phase 1: Foundational Orchestrator & Basic Text Interaction (Updated)

### 1.1 [X] Minimal Orchestrator
- **What We've Done**  
  - Created `Orchestrator` and `OrchestratorConfig` classes.  
  - Implemented a `process_input` method that logs user input and returns a placeholder response.  
  - Added a basic usage script (`basic_usage.py`) to demonstrate how to instantiate and call the Orchestrator.  
  - Confirmed logging works as intended (via `loguru`).

**Usage & Integration**:
```python
from mnemosyne.orchestrator import Orchestrator, OrchestratorConfig

orchestrator = Orchestrator(
    config=OrchestratorConfig(debug=True)
)
response = orchestrator.process_input("Your query here")
```

**Purpose**: Provides the foundation for all agent interactions and workflow management.
**Related Features**: Core component that all other features build upon.

### 1.2 [X] Integrate a Basic Text LLM
1. **Add LLM Client** [X]
   - Implemented `_call_llm()` with support for multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
   - Added fallback provider support for reliability
2. **Refine `process_input`** [X]
   - Now uses actual LLM calls with comprehensive logging
   - Handles errors gracefully with fallback providers
3. **Testing & Validation** [X]
   - Added example in `basic_usage.py`
   - Includes error handling for API issues

**Usage**:
```python
orchestrator = Orchestrator(
    config=OrchestratorConfig(
        primary_provider=LLMProviderConfig(
            provider="openai",
            model="gpt-4"
        ),
        fallback_providers=[...]
    )
)
```

**Purpose**: Enables intelligent responses using state-of-the-art LLMs.
**Related Features**: Foundation for all LLM-based operations.

### 1.3 [X] Basic Memory (In-Memory)
1. **Conversation Buffer** [X]
   - Implemented using `deque` for efficient history management
   - Automatically includes context in LLM prompts
2. **Configuration** [X]
   - Added `history_length` to `OrchestratorConfig`
3. **Testing** [X]
   - Demonstrated in `basic_usage.py`

**Usage**:
```python
orchestrator = Orchestrator(
    config=OrchestratorConfig(
        history_length=10  # Store last 10 messages
    )
)
```

**Purpose**: Enables context-aware conversations.
**Related Features**: Foundation for Vector DB integration.

### 1.4 [X] Enhanced Logging & Debugging
1. **Enhanced Debug Mode** [X]
   - Implemented comprehensive logging with loguru
   - Added structured context for better filtering
2. **Structured Logging** [X]
   - Added file rotation and retention policies
   - Implemented context-aware logging

**Usage**: Debug logs are automatically managed based on config:
```python
orchestrator = Orchestrator(
    config=OrchestratorConfig(debug=True)
)
```

**Purpose**: Facilitates debugging and monitoring.
**Related Features**: Supports all components with standardized logging.

## Phase 2: Multi-Modal & Workflow Patterns

### 2.1 [X] Audio Agent (STT/TTS)
1. **Speech-to-Text Integration** [X]
   - Created `AudioAgent` with Whisper integration
   - Added language detection and transcription
2. **Optional: TTS** [X]
   - Implemented voice selection and synthesis

**Usage**:
```python
from mnemosyne.agents.audio_agent import AudioAgent, AudioConfig

agent = AudioAgent(
    config=AudioConfig(
        model_type="base",
        device="cpu",
        language="en"
    )
)
text = await agent.transcribe("audio.wav")
```

**Purpose**: Enables audio processing capabilities.
**Related Features**: Integrates with Orchestrator for multi-modal input.

### 2.2 [X] Image Agent (OCR, Generation)
1. **OCR** [X]
   - Implemented `ImageAgent` with Tesseract/EasyOCR
   - Added text extraction and processing
2. **Image Generation** [X]
   - Added support for image generation from text

**Usage**:
```python
from mnemosyne.agents.image_agent import ImageAgent

agent = ImageAgent()
text = await agent.extract_text("image.jpg")
```

**Purpose**: Enables image processing and generation.
**Related Features**: Works with Orchestrator and EvaluatorAgent.

### 2.3 [X] Parallelization & Basic Evaluator
1. **Parallelization Example** [X]
   - Added async support to Orchestrator
   - Implemented `run_parallel_tasks`
2. **Evaluator-Optimizer** [X]
   - Created `EvaluatorAgent` for output validation
   - Added configurable evaluation criteria

**Usage**:
```python
# Parallel execution
results = await orchestrator.run_parallel_tasks([
    task1,
    task2
], timeout=30.0)

# Evaluation
evaluator = EvaluatorAgent()
result = await evaluator.evaluate_output(text)
```

**Purpose**: Enables efficient parallel processing and output validation.
**Related Features**: Enhances all agents with parallel capabilities and quality checks.

## Phase 3: Refinement & Memory

### 3.1 Vector Database Integration
1. **Vector Store Setup**  
   - Choose a vector DB (e.g. Pinecone, Weaviate, or local LanceDB).  
   - Implement a small module (`vector_store.py`) for storing and retrieving text embeddings.
2. **Augmented Retrieval**  
   - For each user query, retrieve relevant context from the vector DB to inject into the LLM prompt (RAG approach).
3. **Persisted Memory**  
   - Optionally store conversation turns in the vector DB so that memory can survive restarts.

**Outcome**:  
A more robust memory mechanism and retrieval-augmented generation to reduce hallucinations.

---

### 3.2 Security & Hardening
1. **Auth & Encryption**  
   - If needed, add an API key or OAuth-based authentication for your orchestrator endpoints.  
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g. transcripts, user info).
2. **Error Handling**  
   - Ensure timeouts, rate limiting, and fallback handling for external LLM or STT/OTT calls.

**Outcome**:  
A more reliable system that can handle production-level constraints.

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Workflows & Domain-Specific Agents

### 4.1 Prompt Chaining Library
1. **Chain Utility**  
   - Implement a reusable "PromptChain" class or decorator to define multi-step tasks (Outline → Validate → Expand).  
   - Let the Orchestrator load or execute these chains dynamically based on user requests.
2. **Testing**  
   - Provide small chain examples (like a "blog post writer" flow).

---

### 4.2 Orchestrator-Workers Pattern
1. **Worker Agents**  
   - Allow the Orchestrator to break larger tasks into subtasks, delegate to multiple "worker" LLM calls, then merge results.
2. **Advanced Logging**  
   - Log each subtask's input/output for easy debugging.

---

### 4.3 Enhanced Evaluator-Optimizer
1. **Multi-Criteria Evaluator**  
   - Evaluate based on factual accuracy, style, policy compliance, etc.  
   - Score the output in each category.
2. **Refinement Loop**  
   - If any category is below threshold, automatically generate a "fix prompt" to refine the text.

---

## Phase 5: Performance, Monitoring, & CI/CD

1. **Caching & Rate Control**  
   - Cache repeated LLM responses to reduce API calls.  
   - Implement basic rate limiting if supporting many concurrent users.
2. **Metrics**  
   - Track usage stats, latencies, error rates. Possibly integrate with Prometheus or similar monitoring.
3. **Continuous Integration**  
   - Set up tests to run on each pull request (e.g., GitHub Actions).  
   - Automatically build Docker images on merges to `main`.

---

## Phase 6: Extensions & Community Contributions

1. **Domain-Specific Agents**  
   - E.g. a "Code Generation Agent" that can read/write local files in a restricted sandbox.  
   - A "Legal Document Agent" that references known legal data from the vector store.
2. **UI Integrations**  
   - Optionally create a minimal web front-end or connect to no-code platforms (Rivet, Vellum, etc.).

# Where We Stand

- **Currently**:  
  - You have a **minimal Orchestrator** (`Orchestrator` & `OrchestratorConfig`) with basic logging and a placeholder response.  
  - A usage demo (`basic_usage.py`) confirms that the Orchestrator can handle text input and log the interaction.

- **Next Immediate Step**:  
  - **Tie in a live LLM** (see Phase 1.2) so that `process_input` produces real AI-driven responses.  
  - Then add **short-term in-memory conversation history** (Phase 1.3) for basic multi-turn interactions.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep PRs Small**: Implement each sub-step in its own branch and PR so code reviews remain manageable.  
- **Document as You Go**: Update `README.md` and your docstrings each time you add a new phase or feature.  
- **Test Often**: Each new feature (e.g., `AudioAgent`, `ImageAgent`) should come with at least a small test script or unit test.

With this updated plan, you'll **incrementally build** a powerful multi-modal agentic platform—starting with the **Orchestrator** you've already set up, then layering in specialized agents, memory, retrieval, and advanced workflows.
